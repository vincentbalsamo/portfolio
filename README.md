Hands-on Excel practice with MPT and an Investment Opportunity set done for practice (and for fun!). Used data and examples from the great textbook: "Investments" by Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, and Alan Marcus.
The notebook files are assignments from BUA 611, a graduate business analytics course at St. John's University
