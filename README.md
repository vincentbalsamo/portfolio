Hands-on Excel practice with MPT and an Investment Opportunity set done for practice (and for fun!). Used data and examples from the great textbook: "Investments" by Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, and Alan Marcus.
The notebook files are assignments from BUA 611, a graduate business analytics course at St. John's University
  Homework 1 covers basic data munging Python commands with Pandas and Numpy
  Homework 2 covers classification (e.g., train-test splits, KNeighborsClassifier, Naive Bayes)
  Homework 3 covers regression and data visualization 
  Homework 4 covers training several classifier models (train-test split, Naive Bayes, and evaluating their efficacy (confusion matrix, ROC)
  Homework 5 covers additional classification models and evaluation methods (Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression, Validation Curve)
  Homework 6 covers additional regression techniques (Linear_Model.lasso, Linear_Model.ridge, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regression)
  The Term Paper is a comprehensive notebook covering all topics throughout the semester with a practical example of a large dataset (6,589 rows and 38 features)
